<span class="i0">That day we wandered 'mid the hills,&mdash;so lone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clouds are not lonelier,&mdash;the forest lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In emerald darkness 'round us. Many a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gnarly root, gray-mossed, made wild our way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a bird the glimmering light along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showered the golden bubbles of its song.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then in the valley, where the brook went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Silvering the ledges that it rippled from,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An isolated slip of fallen sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Epitomizing heaven in its sum,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of legend laired.&mdash;And, where no sound intrudes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon the ear, except the glimmering wail<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of some far bird; or, in some flowery swale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brook that murmurs to the solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might think he hears the laugh of Vivien<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blent with the moan of Merlin, muttering bound<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in the cloud, that looms above the glen,&mdash;<br /></span>
